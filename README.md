# Music Player App

This is a Music Player app, developed for my advanced programming course using Java, is designed as a feature-rich Spotify clone. It allows users to play, pause, shuffle, and loop songs, providing a seamless music streaming experience. Artists can manage their songs, while users can search and browse for tracks with ease. The app includes a trending page for popular music, personalized suggestions, and detailed statistics about listening habits. With support for custom playlists and multiple themes, this app offers a dynamic and customizable user experience for music lovers.
